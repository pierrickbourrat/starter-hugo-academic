 am a Senior Lecturer & DECRA Fellow at Macquarie University. I specialise in philosophy of biology. Together with Paul Griffiths, I head the[](https://web.archive.org/web/20220309145848/http://griffithslab.org/) Theory and Method in Biosciences [](https://tmbiosci.org/)group, a joint research group between the University of Sydney and Macquarie University.

From 2017 to 2020 I was a Macquarie University Research Fellow. I completed a PhD in philosophy of biology at the University of Sydney under the supervision of Paul Griffiths in 2015.

My work focuses on core concepts of evolutionary theory such as fitness and heritability, as well as evolutionary transitions in individuality.

My other interests include, the interplay between biological and cultural evolution and the evolution of religious beliefs
